## Hi!

I am a third-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at HKUST. My primary research focus is on machine learning systems, with a particular emphasis on heterogeneous deployments for LLM generative inference and pre-training. Recently, I also work on kernel optimizations for sparse attention mechanisms. Prior to joining HKUST, I completed my undergraduate studies at Peking University.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Binhang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/), whose rigorous and energetic guidance has been invaluable to my research.

For more information about my publications, CV, and other professional activities, please refer to the corresponding pages.
